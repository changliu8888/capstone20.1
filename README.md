I used ML algorithms to fit past stock price data.  I analyzed stock data of related companies in the supply chain, including Apple, Microsoft, Intel, and Applied Materials.  I also started to implement various hypothetical trading strategies to evaluate stock trading gains.
The ML models used include:
•	LSTM RNN analysis of Apple stock price
•	ARIMA time series analysis of Apple stock price
•	Decision tree model of daily movement (up and down)
•	Implemented random walk strategy for stock trading strategy with 4.3% return rate
Raw data is obtained from yahoo finance database.
